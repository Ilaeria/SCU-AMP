# SCU-AMP
Final year capstone project

In the final year of the Bachelor of Information Technology at Southern Cross University, students are required to complete a major project over two sessions, in small team. Students can source their own project, or SCU staff may supply possible projects.

In session 3 2016 a two-person team (Jennifer Doherty and Stephen Manning) chose a project provided by their supervisor, Paul Woods. The project was for a small organisation, Elucidate (http://www.elucidateinsight.com/), run by Jean Stevens. Elucidate's mission is to improve outcomes of organisations who employ, provide services for and educate individuals with a disability. The project was named the About Me Project, or AMP.

The concept of AMP is a website and native app that helps individuals with a disability communicate with their carers and other peoplein their lives. The first half of the project timeline involves creating the background documentation for the project, while the second half covers the actual development tasks.
