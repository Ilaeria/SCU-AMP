                General information
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is User A, I am 12 years old and live in a residential care home, my primary carer is Jed Brown –he's been my PC for 3 years now. My main aim for writing this profile is for you to understand me the best you can. I look like every other kid but often have so much going on in my mind and this causes me to behave in ways that can be very different to other kids.

                Likes and interests
            </p>
            <p>
                I have some activities that I particularly like, these are reading historical fiction and writing about Egypt. I am really great at reading and Math, particularly geometry and am very interested in the chronology of many Sci Fi Series. I am really motivated by quiet praise, time on my devices and logical information when we are problem solving an emotional issue.

                Impairment-specific information
            </p>
            <p>
                I am differently abled due to autism, this affects me in a few ways including socialising and having changes in my daily routine when I don’t understand why they are occurring.  The most significant impact is on my ability to be flexible and accept that things can’t always be as I would like them.

                Dislikes and stressors
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few things that I don’t like such as sarcasm and other s not following rules. I can become stressed or anxious if people are dressed up in costume or thunderstorms are coming. You can help me relax and feel better by allowing me time on my ipod with my ear buds or just giving me some cold water and explaining exactly what is happening. If either of these things doesn’t work then you might need to help me find a place away from everyone and everything with just my ipod and ear buds for a period of time.

                Communication and conversation
            </p>
            <p>
                My main way of communicating is verbally. It is very important that others speak without sarcasm and remember I take things very literally for me to communicate well. If you are unsure just ask “Is there anything you’d like to ask?” or “Are you unsure of anything happening right now? It’s great if you let Jed know everyday how my day has been – email is best and he’ll email you each morning.

                Medication and care needs
            </p>
            <p>
                I have medication and it is due at 10am. Please assist me in making sure the dosage and administration is correct and by only following the instructions on the prescription.

                In addition to the above information I have a great sense of humour and really love making new friends. Sometimes I need a bit of help with this and structuring ‘free’ time really help me with this.
